## What are "branches of government"?

The Framers of the United States Constitution established three branches of government within the Bill of Rights; **Legislative** (established under Article I), **Executive** (established under Article II), and **Judicial** (established under Article III). Each category, or "branch", of government is split into one of these three for the following reasons:

- To ensure "separation of powers", which means that government should be divided into 3 distinct and separate branches to limit the concentration of power.
- To ensure "checks and balances", which ensures that that all of the 3 branches maintain equilibrium by giving each of them checks against one another.

The philosophy of **checks and balances** & **separation of powers** was first described by French philosopher Montesquieu, who was once famously quoted in "The Spirit of Laws" saying the following:

>When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or in the same body of magistrates, there can be no liberty; because apprehensions may arise, lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws, to execute them in a tyrannical manner. Again, there is no liberty if the judiciary power be not separated from the legislative and executive. Were it joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control; for the judge would be then the legislator. Were it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with violence and oppression.
